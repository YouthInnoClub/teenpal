Project for 2016 Verizon Innovative Learning App contest

   Our app idea is an app that addresses the issue of teenage depression.  Between 10 to 15 percent of teenagers 
have some symptoms of depression at any one time, and 20 percent of teenagers will have depression  by the 
time they reach adulthood. Depression increases a teen's risk of attempting suicide by 12 times (1). Each year, 
34,000 people commit suicide, about twice as many deaths as caused by homicide ---- about one death per 15 minutes. 
By 2030, suicide will outpace cancer, stroke, war, and accidents as the world's leading cause of death, according 
to the World Health Organization(2). Teens that suffers from depression can lead to failure in school, alcohol or 
and other drug use and even suicide. Teenagers’ performances in school drop down. The school could lose a loved 
student to suicide. Friends may suffer from losing their friends,  increasing their own chances of suicide, an 
effect known as suicide contagion(3). Suicide causes the people close to the victim grief, and sometimes even 
guilt, leading to great turmoil in the community. Depression is a incredibly pervasive and  destructive problem 
that our app hopes to prevent.

   Our app is an app that will attempt to help teenagers cope with depression. The app will  contain troves of information 
as well as quizzes to to best direct them to a group of kids in a similar situation. It will also have chat rooms for 
users of the app. They can chat with other depressed children or volunteers from the local volunteer group. They can 
sign up for this also, or take a entry quiz to volunteer to be advisors to the teens on this app. The app will also 
attempt to give information about how suicide affects the community, school, friends, and most of all, their family. 
It will let you sign up as either a parent of a depressed child, a depressed child/teenager, or someone who would like
to volunteer to help depressed children. This will hopefully ensure that the users of this app always have someone 
there to help them. It will tell how they can cope, and/or why they should not commit suicide. It will also have many 
safety precautions so that fakes cannot push a depressed child to their suicide.

  This app idea is pretty unique. There are no apps that will serve as a chat for depressed children along with a quiz 
and suicide information. There are some similar apps, such as “GirlGoneHappy” and ”DOLLY Doctor”. They both give information 
about health. “DOLLY Doctor” doesn't really focus on teenage depression, but rather many other categories. They have one 
passage about depression, and not really anything about suicide. “GirlGoneHappy” has a lot of categories of information 
about mental health, stress, and other things, but not as many features, as mainly an information app, and it is mostly 
for girls. There are some depression quizzes, but our app will use depression quizzes to give you the ideal experience. 
This is different from mobile apps currently available because it has many common features grouped into one place. Some 
current apps have diagnostic quizzes, chats, mental health information, among other things, but none focus too much on 
depression, or combine all these features together and completely focus on depression to save kids, families, and 
communities from the tragedy that is suicide.
     
   There are four main features of this app. The first feature will be a questionnaire to attempt to isolate the symptoms 
of the users depression, and give the user a generalized profile to best teenagers together in chat rooms. There will be 
another quiz for potential volunteers to ensure that they are suitable for working with depressed children.The second feature 
of the app will be a chat room where the depressed child with people in similar situations. If you are someone who is volunteering 
to be a advisor, you will have to pass a verification test. It will ask you your birthday, email, and cell phone number, among 
many other important details to ensure all volunteers are qualified. If you pass the test, you will be permitted to advise the 
depressed children. If the app detects any inappropriate behavior, they will be banned, and the users of the app also have the 
option to report.The third feature of the app will be an information section. For the depressed, it will give you information 
on how to cope with your depression, or for the parents of the depressed, how to help your children with their depression. This 
will be information given by psychologists, doctors, trusted websites, and crisis centers. Hopefully, these general tips will 
help the users of this app cope with their depression. 

  The final feature of the app will provide information on suicide. It will tell you about how suicide is not the right option 
and inform you of the toll on your family. It will also tell you the accounts of people who have survived suicide attempts, and 
how they later realized how terrible their decision was.
